Small introduction: 

**contrast_experiments** is a collection of experiments devoted to contrast estimation in FitzHugh-Nagumo model (that's how we get the results from the preprint)

**dimensionality_test_experiments** is more recent, and it has few pretty cool functions, namely:
+ *gather_statistics* (implementation of statistical tests from paper by Jean Jacod and Mark Podolskij "A test for the rank of the volatility process: the random perturbation approach")
+ *hawkes_approximation* (implementation of the stochastic diffusion which approximates the Hawkes process, from paper by Eva LÃ¶cherbach and Susanne Ditlevsen "Multi-class oscillating systems of interacting neurons)
+ *FHN.simulate* (simulations of FitzHugh-Nagumo model with higher-order scheme)
